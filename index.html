        <h3>THE COMPRESSED STORY</h3></header>
            <p>DVD (pronounced "David") Goodwin, pronouns he/him/his or they/them/their.</p>
            <p>DVD is a dynamic professional with a unique journey from pastoral care to corporate innovation. He is currently enrolled full-time at Grand Circus Coding Bootcamp, studying full-stack C#/.net/Java in order to launch a career in software engineering.</p>

        <h2>BLOGGING</h2>
        <img height="100px" src="https://nancystohlman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/writer.jpg" alt="definitely a real image of DVD writing a blog" align="left"/>
            <p>Ever since DVD can remember, they wrote fiction for a hobby. 
            <br>Was it good fiction? Who knows. In high school, he wrote a serial murder mystery about a high school sleuth named Lewis Beacon. 
            <br>After college, he organized a website called HOW WE LOST THE MOON, publishing submissions both from DVD and friends every new moon. 
            <br>Today, some of DVD's contributions can be found on <a href="https://medium.com/@dvdgoodwin">their medium blog</a>. 
            <br>Whether such a hobby will survive writing code for a career is yet to be seen, but no matter what, DVD remains forever a writer.</p>

        <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <img height="100px" src="https://surry.edu/uploads/images/_videoPoster/programming_WEB.jpg" alt="definitely a real image of DVD coding" align="right"/>
            <p>Now that DVD is in Grand Circus, all of his writing has been in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
            <br>Looking over <a href="https://github.com/kinDVD">his GitHub</a>, you will find a progression in programs, from a simple inventory calculator to a multi-class, object oriented terminal game.
            <br>For his first group project, he worked with a team of fellow students to create a retail Point of Sale system incorporating a dynamic inventory list acessible from an employee login. 
            <br>He has humble beginnings, but through his commitment to diligence and constant practice, DVD shows a lot of promise as a future software engineer.</p>

        <h2>HOMETOWN</h2>
        <img height="100px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Troy%2C_MI_location.png/1280px-Troy%2C_MI_location.png" alt = "the square of Michigan" align ="left"/>
        <p>DVD was born in <a href="https://youtu.be/oKDjis1fg8E?si=SPbeNRTbd5-bv7JN&t=21">Cleveland, OH</a>, under a Pisces sign, before almost immediately transplanting to Pennsylvania. 
            <br>They lived for a time in Harrisburg, and later Pittsburgh, before finally settling in Troy, MI. 
            <br>Michigan will remain a state of beauty;Troy was anything but, with ten square miles of gridded neighborhoods and strip plazas. 
            <br>It was DVD's hometown, but while their peers embraced the town as their forever homes, DVD reacted to it by forever leaving. 
            <br>They have since lived in Seoul, ROK; Chicago, IL; and now Jersey City, NJ, part of the NYC metro.</p>
