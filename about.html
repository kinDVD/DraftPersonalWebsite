    <h1>BIO</h1>
    <p>With a rich background as a Christian pastor, David transitioned into the corporate realm in the 2020s, bringing a compassionate and human-centric approach to his new field.
        Davidâ€™s career could be characterized by his dedication to empathy, equality, and uplifting humanity. He has volunteered for the past decade, community organizing around issues of social justice and progressive policy change. <br>
        His childhood dream was to become a Christian pastor, but he left the religion entirely toward the end of his graduate program. 
        Following the pandemic, he climbed from food service into a B2B sales position, eventually coming to work for a coding bootcamp called Tech Elevator. 
        There he gained a true exposure to software development and a desire to to learn coding for himself.<br> 
        As he progresses in his tech education, David continues to integrate his values of empathy and inclusivity into his professional and personal life, aiming to meaningfully contribute to both the tech industry, and the broader global community.
        It is perhaps for this reason that his current extracurricular project is called <i>Land the Baja</i>: a terminal game where a player must use clues to find the traitors in their crew, and eject them, before they land(or crash). <b>;P</b></p>
